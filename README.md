# COMP210_2_interace_task


## Proposal
I intend to produce a VR game where the user will remain to stay in one place within the a simple 3D environment and will use a gun to kill flying enemies that will randomly appear flying throughout the room. The user will go through multiple waves/rounds of enemies that will increase in numbers as the waves/rounds increase. 

## Market Research
From my market research it appears that there are a few VR shooters that already exist with both unique and fun mechanics, in order to make mine stand out from these I will have to think of various ways to implement new features within my VR game to make it both fun and new to the user. [Superhot](https://superhotgame.com/) is the closest game I would compare the gameplay I intend to create with a few different ways of changing the gameplay.

## Design
I intend to make use of a Vive tracker and also an arduino to create a fire mechanism connected to a cardboard gun prop to further immerse the user within the game. 

## Constraints
The only constraints that I feel like I will come accross are both time or lack of knowledge to complete a trigger mechanism for the arduino. Another constraint would be audio input, I have no previous experience with audio input within Unreal itself so this could potentially be a challenge.

The gameplay in the video above shows a user selecting to start the game, killing multiple enemies and also progressing through 3 waves/rounds.
